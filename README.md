# abus_wAppLoxx
Python script to open door

This is just a quick script, which connects with you credentials to your abus smartlock and opens.

Please note:

- This is just the work of one hour, i bet this can be improved if you want to
- I assume your abus device can be reached via the hostname "abus" in your local network (feel free to replace)
- No big security measures have been implemented - use at your own risk
