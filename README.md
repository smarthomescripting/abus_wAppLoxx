# abus_wAppLoxx
Python script to control ABUS wAppLoxx Control

This is just a simple script, which connects with your credentials to the ABUS wAppLoxx Control (SE), opens the door and logs out. You can easily integrate into your smarthome (FHEM, Openhab).

Please note:

- This is just the work of one hour, i bet this can be improved if you want to
- I assume your abus device can be reached via the hostname "abus" in your local network (feel free to replace or rename the host)
- No big security measures have been implemented - use at your own risk (e.g. you might want to secure the credentials in a vault and put security around the script)
